This host-conf directory contains files that are specific to a HOST.

For example, on some test hosts, we want to setup different PATH environment
variable that is not suitable to be inclued in git repo.

To do that, set the environment in host.sh.

host-pre.sh:  executed before invoke oh-my-zsh
host-post.sh executed after invoke oh-my-zsh
