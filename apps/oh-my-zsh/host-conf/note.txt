This host-conf directory contains files that are specific to a HOST.

For example, on some test hosts, we want to setup different PATH environment
variable that is not suitable to be inclued in git repo.

Files suffixed with `-pre.sh` such as `host-pre.sh` are loaded before invoking oh-my-zsh.
Files suffixed with `-post.sh` such as `host-post.sh` are loaded after invoking oh-my-zsh.

You can index these files by prefixing number, such as `01-init-pre.sh`. The files are sourced one after another accoding to their index.
